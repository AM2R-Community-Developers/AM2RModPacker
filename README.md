# AM2RModPacker
Mod packaging toolchain for [AM2RLauncher](https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers/AM2RLauncher) mods.

This is for modcreators who wish to make their mods usable with the [AM2RLauncher](https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers/AM2RLauncher).
It currently supports creating Windows, Linux and Android mods.

For actual mod creation, it is recommended to use Game Maker: Studio and the [AM2R Community Updates repository](https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers/AM2R-Community-Updates), but they can be created with [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool) as well. 

## Usage instructions
Currently todo, as they should be self-explanatory anyways.
